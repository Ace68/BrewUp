Example of evolving from monolithic to microservices architecture

## Monolithic
Organizations can benefit from either a monolithic or microservices architecture, depending on a number
of different factors. When developing using monolithic architecture, the primary advantage is fast
development speed due to the simplicity of having an application based on one code base.

The advantages of a monolithic architecture include:
- Easy deployment
- Development
- Performance
- Simplified testing
- Easy debugging

Monolithic applications can be quite effective until they grow too large and scaling becomes a challenge.
Making a small change in a single function requires compiling and testing the entire platform, 
which goes agains the agile approach today's developers favor.

The disadvantages of a monolithic include:
- Slower development speed
- Reliability
- Barrier to technology adoption
- Lack of flexibility
- Deployment
